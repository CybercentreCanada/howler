# Howler Templates

Howler is, fundamentally, an application that allows analysts to triage hits and alerts. In order to make sure analysts can do this as efficiently as possible, we want to have the ability to present relevant data for a given alert to analysts in an easy, understandable way.

To this end, Howler allows analysts and detection engineers to create **templates**, which allow various analytics and their detections to present fields and data relevant to triaging alerts generated by that analytic/detection. For example, let's consider two different alerts, by two different detections:

```json
$ALERT_1
```

```json
$ALERT_2
```

Note that while both share some similar fields, they also differ. We want each of these alert cards to present different data - for that, we can use templates. This allows us to show both hits in the same list, but with differing fields displayed:

===SPLIT===

As we can see, by specifying a template for each of the detections, different data will be presented to the analyst. To do so, you can use the template creator [here]($CURRENT_URL/templates/view?type=personal).

```alert
Note that you must have ingested some hits for the given analytic/detection pair for it to show as an option in the template creation UI!
```
