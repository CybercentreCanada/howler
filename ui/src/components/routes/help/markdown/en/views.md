# Views

Views are a feature in Howler that allows users to create custom, default queries through which they can organize and triage hits. In this document, we will outline how to create and interact with views.

## Using a View

You can use views by navigating to the view manager under [Manage > Views](/views). Clicking on any view will open it in the search page. Here, you can also use the `search` icon to open the view in the search page. You can also edit views that belong to you, and mark them as favourites. This will show them in the `t(route.views.saved)` dropdown in the sidebar. In the top right, you can also choose your "`t(route.views.manager.default)`", that will be selected by default when opening the alerts page.

## Creating Views

In order to create a view, you can use the create view page, located [here](/views/create). This page allows you to modifer your view, specify a `t(hit.search.sort.fields)` and `t(hit.search.span)`, and save the view with a particular name. You can mark a view as global or personal, depending on who you want to be able to see and use the view.
